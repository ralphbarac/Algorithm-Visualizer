# algorithm-visualizer

## Description

This project is the base for a pathfinding algorithm visualizer. It currently runs Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph from start (the red) to end (the green) nodes, highlighting in yellow the shortest path and in light blue every visited node.

## Deployment Link

https://ralphbarac.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/

## Usage

Click and drag to create walls. Clicking on the 'Dijkstra's' button will animate the path, and clicking 'Reset Board' will remove walls and set the board state back to normal.

## Known Bugs

Clicking and dragging to add walls is a little bit janky currently.

## To Dos

- Smoothing out the animations
- Making the grid larger
- Adding more pathfinding algorithms
- Allowing the user to move the start and end nodes around (as well as adding weighted nodes)
- Potentially adding random wall generation
